# Huffman File Compression

This C++ program compresses a given text file using Huffman encoding, a lossless data compression algorithm. The program reads a file, builds a Huffman Tree based on the frequency of characters in the file, generates binary codes for each character, and encodes the file using those codes.

## Features
- Builds a Huffman Tree based on character frequencies.
- Generates unique Huffman codes for each character in the file.
- Compresses the file into a binary encoded form using the Huffman codes.

## Requirements
To compile and run this program, you need:
- C++11 or later.
- A C++ compiler such as `g++` (GCC) or `clang++`.
- A text file (`input.txt`) that you want to compress.

## Installation
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Compile the C++ code using your preferred compiler.

Example using `g++`:
```bash
g++ -o huffman_compression huffman_compression.cpp
```

3. Make sure to have an `input.txt` file in the same directory as the compiled program.

## Usage
Once compiled, run the program to compress your input file:
```bash
./huffman_compression
```

### Input File:
- The input file must be named `input.txt` and placed in the same directory as the executable.

### Output:
- The compressed output is saved as `compressed.bin` in the same directory.

### Example:
```bash
$ ./huffman_compression
File compressed successfully!
```

## Code Structure
- `Node` struct: Represents a node in the Huffman tree. Each node stores a character, its frequency, and pointers to its left and right children.
- `generateCodes()`: Recursively traverses the Huffman Tree to generate binary codes for each character.
- `buildHuffmanTree()`: Constructs the Huffman Tree and generates the Huffman codes based on character frequencies in the input file.
- `compressFile()`: Reads the input file, builds the Huffman tree, and writes the encoded data to a binary output file.

## Limitations and Future Enhancements
- **Binary output**: The current implementation writes the encoded data as a string of `0`s and `1`s. Future versions can write real binary data for more efficient storage.
- **Decoding**: The program currently only handles compression. The decoding process (to restore the original file) can be added as a future enhancement.
- **Padding**: To write binary data, padding techniques should be implemented to ensure that the bits align correctly.
